# ⚡ matchbook

A high-performance limit order book implementation in Rust, supporting multiple order types with price-time priority matching.

## Background

Many existing trading engines are written in C++. Rust offers many advantages such as:

- Zero-cost abstractions
- Strong compile-time guarantees
- Safer concurrency and memory management

This project serves as a learning experiment in translating a C++ order book into Rust

## Features

- **Order Types**
  - **Good Till Cancelled (GTC)** - Rests on book until filled or manually cancelled
  - **Fill and Kill (FAK)** - Partial fills allowed, unfilled remainder cancelled immediately
  - **Fill or Kill (FOK)** - Must fill entirely or reject, no partial fills
  - **Good for Day (GFD)** - Rests on book until filled or end-of-day prune
  - **Market** - Executes immediately at best available price, unfilled remainder cancelled

- **Matching Engine**
  - Price-time priority (FIFO at each price level)
  - Supports aggressive orders crossing the spread
  - Efficient BTreeMap-based price level management

- **Trade Recording**
  - Full trade history with bid/ask details
  - Tracks order IDs, prices, and quantities for each side

- **CI & Testing**
  - **Unit tests** - Located in each module (`#[cfg(test)]`), test internal logic
  - **Integration tests** - Located in `tests/`, test public API behavior
  - **85%+ Test Coverage** - Generated by `tarpaulin`
  - **Continuous Integration** - Github Actions worklow on every push and PR
